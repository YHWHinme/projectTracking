## Branch Lifecycle Management
This file is updated dynamically as branches change:

### When Creating a Branch:
- Add new branch section with status, owner, dependencies
- Update merge priority queue
- Document planned work and remaining tasks

### When Merging a Branch:
- Remove branch section entirely (no historical record)
- Update main branch status with new features
- Update dependencies for remaining branches
- Reorder merge priority queue

### When Deleting a Branch:
- Remove branch section entirely (no historical record)
- Update any dependent branches

## Development Guidelines for New Branches
- **Branch Naming:** `feature/feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-description`
- **Commit Messages:** `feat: add feature` or `fix: resolve issue`
- **Testing:** Manual testing required before merge
- **Documentation:** Update this file when creating new branches
- **Dependencies:** Clearly document branch dependencies

## Emergency Procedures
- **Lost Work:** Check git history and branch backups
- **Merge Conflicts:** Communicate immediately with team
- **Breaking Changes:** Test thoroughly before merging to main
- **Rollbacks:** Use git revert for safe rollbacks
